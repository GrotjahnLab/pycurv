"""
Contains a function for splitting a tomogram segmentation in connected regions
of certain label and minimal size.

The idea is to work on each region separately, e.g. create a surface, transform
it to a graph, clean and calculate curvatures.

    Splits the segmentation in connected regions with at least the given size

        lbl (int, optional) the label to be considered, 0 will be ignored,

            segmentation first
        close_cube_size (int, optional): if close is True, gives the size of the
            cube structuring element used for closing, default 5
